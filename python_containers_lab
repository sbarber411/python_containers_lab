# Exercise 1
# Create a list named students containing some student names (strings).
# Print out the second student's name.
# Print out the last student's name.

students = ['Tevin', 'Sophia', 'Aubrey', 'Ava']
print(students[1])
print(students[-1])

# Exercise 2
# Create a tuple named foods containing the same number of foods (strings) as there are names in the students list.
# Use a for loop to print out the string "food goes here is a good food".

foods = ('Pizza', 'Pasta', 'Fried Chicken', 'Rice and Beans')
for food in foods:
  print(f"{food} is a good food")

# Exercise 3
# Using a for loop, print just the last two food strings from foods.
  
for food in foods[-2:]:
	  print(food)

# Exercise 4
# Create a dictionary named home_town containing the keys of city, state and population.
# Print a string with this format:
# "I was born in city, state - population of population"

home_town = {
  'city': 'Newark',
  'state':'New Jersey',
  'population': '312,000'
}

print(f"I was born in {home_town.get('city')}, {home_town.get('state')}- population of {home_town.get('population')}")

# Exercise 5
# Iterate over the key: value pairs in home_town and print a string for each item, for example:
  # 'city':'Newark',
  # 'state':'New Jersey',
  # 'population': '312,000'

for item in home_town.items():
  print(f"{item[0]} = {item[1]}")


#   Exercise 6
# Create an empty list named cohort.
# Using a for loop, add one dictionary to the cohort list for each student name. Each dictionary should have this shape:
  #  {
#    'student': 'Tina',
#    'fav_food' 'Cheeseburger'
#  }
# Iterate over cohort printing out each element.

cohort = []
for num in range(len(students)):
	cohort.append({'student': students[num], 'fav_food': foods[num]})

for student in cohort:
	print(student)
 
# Exercise 7
# Using the list of students and list comprehension, assign to a variable named awesome_students a new list containing strings similar to this:
# ["Tina is awesome!", "Fred is awesome!", "Wilma is awesome!"]
# Iterate over awesome_students printing out each string.
  
msg = ' is awesome!'
awesome_students = [student + msg for student in students]

for student in awesome_students:
	print(student)


# Exercise 8
#Using the tuple foods and list comprehension within a for loop, print each food string that contains the letter a.


for food in foods: 
  food_string = f"{food} is a good food"
  if food_string.find("a") != -1:
    print(food_string)
